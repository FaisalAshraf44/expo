# expo-firebase-core

Core support for the native Google Firebase SDK. This library ensures that Google Firebase is initialized natively and makes it possible to use 
native Firebase features from other unimodules.

# API documentation

- [Documentation for the master branch](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/docs/pages/versions/unversioned/sdk/firebase.md)

# Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.
